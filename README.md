# XWiki CLI

XWiki CLI is a command-line tool to manipulate XWiki content on XWiki instances and extension repositories. It aims at:

* improving experience when developping on top of XWiki
* providing tools to automatise actions on XWiki content

Contrary to most other XWiki contrib packages, it runs outside XWiki. It is not a XWiki extension.
